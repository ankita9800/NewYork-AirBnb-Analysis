## NewYork-AirBnb-Analysis-Dashboard

This project explores the Airbnb market in New York City, focusing on the various types of accommodations available and their associated costs. As a popular platform for travelers, Airbnb offers a unique experience that differs from traditional hotel stays, with many listings located in trendy neighborhoods.   

To better understand this market, I designed interactive dashboards using Tableau to analyze a dataset and quantify costs based on various factors such as bed availability, region, ratings, property type, and price. By streamlining user requirements with multiple parameters, calculations, trend lines, and reference lines, the resulting dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data, enabling users to gain valuable insights into the Airbnb market in New York City. Additionally, I utilized an in-built future forecasting tool to provide a forward-looking outlook and predict the average price for the next year, allowing users to plan their trips with greater accuracy. 

Overall, this project offers a visually appealing and user-friendly way to explore the Airbnb market in New York City and gain a better understanding of the costs associated with different types of accommodations.
